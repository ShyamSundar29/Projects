## üìù Abstract

Brain tumors pose significant risks to cognitive functions, making early detection critical for improving patient outcomes. This project introduces three novel multi-class deep learning architectures leveraging **transfer learning** to classify brain tumors from T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI images. 

### üåü Key Contributions:
- Achieved **99.19% accuracy** using the **Xception model** with optimized batch normalization and learning rates.
- Minimized computational overhead by avoiding preprocessing, segmentation, hybrid models, and augmentation techniques.
- Reduced the number of fully connected layers to streamline computation.
- Fine-tuned the learning rate of the SGD optimizer using **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**.

Our approach demonstrates the potential for early and accurate brain tumor detection, providing a practical solution for neuro-oncologists.
