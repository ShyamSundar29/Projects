## üìù Description
Depression is a mental disorder that might cause self-harm and suicidal thoughts if the level of depression reaches the refractory or recurrent depressive disorder stage. Depression can be categorized into four different levels defined by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI): minimal, mild, moderate, and severe. The level of depression is essential in narrowing down the selection of therapy options. 

This study introduces a Deep Learning (DL) architecture trained on time-frequency images derived from EEG signals to predict the patient‚Äôs respondent status to SSRI antidepressant therapy. We propose an efficient framework that integrates image techniques with state-of-the-art DL models. Among various time-frequency methods‚Äîincluding Wavelet Synchrosqueezed Transform (WSST), Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)‚ÄîWSST demonstrated superior performance in capturing crucial features from EEG signals.

The proposed framework outperformed advanced architectures like EfficientNetV2L, ResNet152V2, Xception, DenseNet201, and MobileNetV2, achieving an accuracy level of **98.89%** with a custom lightweight CNN architecture. 

The results underscore how DL models can improve clinical decision-making, leading to tailored treatments and enhanced quality of life for depression patients.
